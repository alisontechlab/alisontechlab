<p>You must be of legal age to enter into a binding agreement in order to accept the Terms. If you do not agree to the General Terms, do not use any of our Services. If you agree to the General Terms and do not agree to any Service Specific Terms, do not use the corresponding Service. You can accept the Terms by checking a checkbox or clicking on a button indicating your acceptance of the terms or by actually using the Services.</p>
<p><strong>Description of Service</strong></p>
<p>We provide an array of services for online collaboration and management including word processor, Work book app, Quiz application, spreadsheet, chat client, organizer, customer relationship management application and project management application (&quot;Service&quot; or &quot;Services&quot;). You may use the Services for your personal and business use or for internal business purpose in the organization that you represent. You may connect to the Services using any Internet browser or Mobile Applications supported by the Services. You are responsible for obtaining access to the Internet and the equipment necessary to use the Services. You can create and edit content with your user account and if you choose to do so, you can publish and share such content.</p>
<p><strong>Subscription to Beta Service</strong></p>
<p>We may offer certain Services as closed or open beta services (&quot;Beta Service&quot; or &ldquo;Beta Services&rdquo;) for the purpose of testing and evaluation. You agree that we have the sole authority and discretion to determine the period of time for testing and evaluation of Beta Services. We will be the sole judge of the success of such testing and the decision, if any, to offer the Beta Services as commercial services. You will be under no obligation to acquire a subscription to use any paid Service as a result of your subscription to any Beta Service. We reserve the right to fully or partially discontinue, at any time and from time to time, temporarily or permanently, any of the Beta Services with or without notice to you. You agree that Alisontechlab will not be liable to you or to any third party for any harm related to, arising out of, or caused by the modification, suspension or discontinuance of any of the Beta Services for any reason.</p>

<p>We may modify the Terms upon notice to you at any time through a service announcement or by sending email to your primary email address. If we make significant changes to the Terms that affect your rights, you will be provided with at least 30 days advance notice of the changes by email to your primary email address. You may terminate your use of the Services by providing Alisontechlab notice by email within 30 days of being notified of the availability of the modified Terms if the Terms are modified in a manner that substantially affects your rights in connection with use of the Services. In the event of such termination, you will be entitled to prorated refund of the unused portion of any prepaid fees. Your continued use of the Service after the effective date of any change to the Terms will be deemed to be your agreement to the modified Terms.</p>

If you represent an organization and wish to use the Services for corporate internal use, we recommend that you, and all other users from your organization, sign up for user accounts by providing your corporate contact information.

<p><strong>Organization Accounts and Administrators</strong></p>
<p>When you sign up for an account for your organization you may specify one or more administrators. The administrators will have the right to configure the Services based on your requirements and manage end users in your organization account.

In the absence of any specified administrator account recovery process, Alisontechlab may provide control of an administrator account to an individual providing proof satisfactory to Alisontechlab demonstrating authorization to act on behalf of the organization. You agree not to hold Alisontechlab liable for the consequences of any action taken by Alisontechlab in good faith in this regard.</p>
